The stock currently trades below its three- year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x, reflecting the company's reduced revenue growth outlook (vs. the past three years). KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to any significant slowdown in iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's large size makes it more vulnerable to regulatory oversight and the attendant legal costs and uncertainty. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases.

AAPL, AAPL US Price: $105.92 Spring 2016 Event: Lower-than-Expected Price on 18 March 2016 iPhone SE and Price Cut on the Watch - ALERT Apple launched the new 4â€ iPhone SE at a starting price of $399, ~$50 lower than we                    Telecom & Networking had expected. We see this as a positive for the company, as it opens new market                        Equipment/IT Hardware opportunity for Apple. The company also reduced the price of the Apple Watch by                        Rod Hall, CFA AC $50. Finally, Apple inched closer to our iAnywhere thesis again with the 9.7\" iPad                     (1-415) 315-6713 Pro, though we continue to believe further iOS changes are needed to make the iPad                     rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com Pro products true laptop replacements. Overall, we believe earnings expectations for                   Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> F2016 are conservative given better recent macro indications and our own higher                        J.P. Morgan Securities LLC current forecast. Tactically, we see now as as good a time as any to add to Apple                      Ashwin Kesireddy positions given lower iPhone pricing and cautious expectations.

Morgan Securities LLC expected announcement of iPhone SE, which has a starting price of $399 for the                       Rajagopal RK Raghunathan 16GB version. The 64GB version costs $499. We see the ~$50 drop in the iPhone                        (1-415) 315-6760 price umbrella as a positive given likely high price elasticity effects. Though it is                rajagopal.raghunathan@jpmorgan.com possible that the SE will deliver lower margin, we believe it is premature to assume                 J.P. Morgan Securities LLC this.

New bands were also announced. ï‚· 4â€ iPhone volume: Apple noted that it sold more than 30m 4â€ iPhones in 2015. Specifically in China, of the 4â€ iPhones sold in the country, Apple said that more than 50% are first time iPhone buyers, indicating strong demand for the 4â€ form factor. Apple plans to take pre-orders starting on March 24 with expected availability on March 31. The company plans to make the new iPhones available in 110 countries by the end of May. Our checks suggest ~12m iPhone SE orders in the supply chain for CY16. ï‚· New 9.7â€ iPad Pro starting at $599: Apple announced the addition of a 9.7â€ iPad Pro as expected. The starting price of new iPad Pro is $599 for the 32GB version, increasing to $749 for 128GB version and $899 for the 256GB version. Apple also added a nice new Truetone display, which adjusts display color to surroundings. ï‚· iOS 9.3 and tvOS updates: Apple announced that iOS 9.3, which includes the much awaited NightShift feature (reduces blue light at night), will be available for download today.

Apple markets the Pro as a PC and Windows Surface replacement, and focuses on demonstrating work use cases, especially for creative roles (Apple quotes three in their press release). Management also noted that there are 600M five- year old PCs in the installed base. We think the 9.7\" Pro - with a starting price of $599 vs. the 9.7\" Air 2 at $499 - could improve iPad ASPs and margins, especially with better accessories attach (Pencil costs $99 and Smart Keyboard costs $149). Social issues are becoming a bigger topic. Apple spent roughly one-third of the hour-long keynote today discussing three issues: encryption, environment and health. Since Tim Cook took over as CEO, he has slowly become more vocal on social issues so this has been a consistent trend for Apple, and somewhat true for the tech industry overall.

The company currently trades below its three-year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x; we believe the multiple is justified for its reduced revenue growth outlook (comparing to the past three years). KEY RISKS 1) Apple\\'s growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors\\' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple\\'s size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases.

Supply chain revisions have bottomed. Our Asia tech team led by Jasmine Lu believes supply chain inventory digestion has come to an end. She currently models 40M builds for both the March and June quarters. However, suppliers built an extra 10M inventory in 2015 which is likely to sell through in the March quarter. Note that a flat Q/Q build for the June quarter is above typical seasonality of a low- to high-teens decline. A new 4\" iPhone could provide an additional boost Last week, Apple sent invitations for an event on their campus on Monday, March 21. They will likely announce a refresh to the current 4\" iPhone (5s), which has been in the market since September 2013. It\\'s possible the new iPhone ships before the end of the March quarter (ends 3/27) but the bulk of the contribution will come in the        Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with June quarter, helping explain better than seasonal builds.                         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

In other words, we don\\'t expect gross margin to drift lower with iPhone ASP. We also expect less cannibalization risk than with the 5c launched in 2013 given the large screen installed base that is unlikely to downgrade. Debate 3: Has smartphone innovation come to an end? We see revolutionary features including foldable OLED, wireless charging technology launching in the next 1-2 years. Barring new wireless charging technology, which we think has <50% probability of making it into iPhone 7, we see most features as iterative with growth driven by upgrades of a larger installed base post share gains in FY15. The new 4\" iPhone will help improve growth as we head into the end of the iPhone 6s cycle, with the potential to expand share in emerging markets, including India and China. Importantly, we only assume             Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with 15% of shipments come from new users in FY17, compared to 45% in FY15.               companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Investors should consider Morgan and services disclosure as a sign of increased focus on monetizing Apple\\'s 1         Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their billion devices in use. But, even without acquisitions or new services, growth is    investment decision. accelerating and Apple\\'s enterprise value is nearly 30% below Internet peers         For analyst certification and other important disclosures, refer to the Disclosure Section, located at the end of this despite better revenue and profit metrics per user. Both Apple Music and Apple       report. TV added hundreds of millions of revenues Q/Q in the Dec Q. We see the 82 1 Apple, Inc. | February 3, 2016 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH potential for streaming video service and content for new categories like virtual reality and autos adding incremental value over time. While there are cleaner stories in tech â€“ FB, MSFT in particular â€“ there arenâ€™t cheaper names. Apple\\'s low valuation stands out, especially among platform companies with high customer loyalty, ability to return significant cash ($49B LTM) while also invest in the future (R&D up 24%, capex up 34% in FY16). We think investors are concerned about Apple\\'s macro comments and many are waiting for the next earnings call to see if fundamentals get worse. We still see an attractive risk/reward heading into the iPhone 7 cycle as iPhone shipments return to growth. 83 2 Apple, Inc. | February 3, 2016 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH Risk Reward World\\'s Most Valuable Technology Platform Enhanced by New Devices and Services $ 200 Investment Thesis 180                                                                                                             $180.00 (+87%)                           Apple has the world\\'s most valuable technology platform with over one billion active devices, and 160 we believe it is best positioned to capture more of 140                                                                                                                                                      its users\\' time in areas such as health, autos and $135.00 (+40%) 120                                                                                                                                                      home, as these platforms expand in the Internet of 100 $96.35                                                                  Things computing era.

That's material, but keys to monitor are the amount of business AAPL moves, how quickly they move it, and AWS's ability to continue to take share in its $240bn market.

AAPL, AAPL US Price: $94.09 FQ1'16 10-Q review: Lower ESPs boost ASPs, zero 28 January 2016 Dec buyback, margins up outside US/Europe - ALERT ï‚· Lower ESPs helped ASPs by about $5: Note that Apple lowered the                                      Telecom & Networking ESP (estimated selling price) for software upgrades on iOS devices and                               Equipment/IT Hardware Macs by $5-10 recently (Click here for our note). We estimate that this                              Rod Hall, CFA AC accounting change helped ASPs by $5 on a Y/Y basis. After adjusting                                  (1-415) 315-6713 rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com for the $49 Y/Y FX impact, we estimate that the underlying iPhone ASP Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> grew by $47 Y/Y, instead of the reported $3 Y/Y increase. We continue                                J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to believe this change gives the company further flexibility to adjust Ashwin Kesireddy prices down if the FX situation continues to deteriorate.                                            (1-415) 315-6756 ï‚· Zero repurchases in December. Apple repurchased 0 shares in                                          ashwin.x.kesireddy@jpmorgan.com J.P. Morgan Securities LLC Decemberâ€”the first month since July 2013 when Apple made no Rajagopal RK Raghunathan repurchases. As an offset, we note that Apple entered into a $3bn ASR                                (1-415) 315-6760 in November. In our preview, we estimated that Appleâ€™s repurchases                                   rajagopal.raghunathan@jpmorgan.com slowed Y/Y (click here for our note), but Appleâ€™s additional disclosure                              J.P. Morgan Securities LLC implies steeper reductions in buybacks toward the end of the quarter                                 Bala R Reddy than we anticipated. The company normally slows repurchases in the last                              (91-22) 6157-3373 month of a quarter, but making no repurchases in December is abnormal,                               bala.reddy@jpmorgan.com J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in our opinion. ï‚· Purchase commitments decline in line with guidance: Appleâ€™s purchase commitments declined by 30% or $8.8bn Q/Q to $20.7bn. We see this to be largely consistent with the 32% Q/Q decline implied by the midpoint of Appleâ€™s FQ2 revenue guidance. The companyâ€™s other commitments, which consists of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments, advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations, grew $600m Q/Q, which is slightly above the $500m Q/Q growth in FQ1â€™15. ï‚· FX derivatives: We estimate that FX derivatives hurt Appleâ€™s gross margin by 0.3pp in FQ1â€™16. By proportionately allocating revenue hedging gains we estimate that underlying ASPs for iPhone would have been up by $26 Q/Q vs. the $20 reported. ï‚· Profitability grew outside the US and Europe: Appleâ€™s GAAP EBIT margin grew by 1.8pp Y/Y in Greater China, 1.1pp Y/Y in Japan, and 1.9pp Y/Y in RoAPAC. However, it declined by 0.8pp in the Americas and 1.9pp Y/Y in Europe. ï‚· Regionally allocated SG&A increases: Regionally allocated SG&A grew to 3.7% of sales in FQ1'16 from 3.3% in FQ1'15. ï‚· No major changes to risk factors.

The        e = Morgan Stanley Research estim ates, a = Actual Com pany reported data gross margin component of the F1Q16 gain was $306M, compared to an average of $542M in FY15. Apple continues to invest for the future. It ended the December quarter with $28.6B of off-balance sheet commitments, growing 12% Y/Y but decelerating from 38% average Y/Y growth in FY15 (Exhibit 5) to reflect the slowdown in unit and revenue growth. These commitments to acquire components and capital assets (including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment), and for advertising and R&D are a good indicator of future revenue with correlation of 95% since 2007. The correlation would imply close to $65B of revenue in the March quarter. While we do not think this is likely the outcome, we believe this is a sign of Apple's confidence in its future products and initiatives to take advantage of favorable commodity              Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with markets. Management also maintained their $15B capital expenditure                    companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, guidance for FY16.

We currently expect Apple to repurchase $8B a quarter for the rest of FY16 to total $31B for the year through the open market or ASRs. We believe Apple looks at its fully- taxed FCF as a measure of its buyback capacity. Assuming low $50B fully-taxed FCF over the next year, we believe Apple can repurchase close to $40B of shares while increasing the dividend slightly to $12B. Apple repurchased $35B in FY15 and $45B in FY14. Note that Apple has historically returned cash at a faster pace than what is implied by the capital return program, which we expect to be updated the day of March quarter earnings. No change in macroeconomic and currency-related risk factors. Despite management spending more than the usual amount of time on macro headwinds during the recent earnings call, there were no new disclosures in the latest 10-Q. We looked back at Apple's filings in 2009 and 2013 when the stock had ~50% corrections, and found no additional risk factors compared to the current 10-Q. The exception was a disclosure in 2009 that noted Apple had only one wireless provider in some countries, which is no longer the case. We also compared 2013 filings to earlier ones, and found a few interesting new disclosures: (1) gross margins will be lower in FY13, (2) Apple makes prepayments to or invests in certain suppliers and if these suppliers experience financial problems Apple's investment may be devalued, and (3) litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to operations and distracting to management. New disclosures in 2009 filings compared to previous ones include: (1) the financial crisis could impact Apple's business and stock price, (2) margins may decrease from FY08 levels, (3) Steve Jobs was taking a medical leave of absence, (4) Apple may raise prices to offset foreign currency headwinds, and (5) a few disclosures about the iPhone and the App Store, which was relatively new at the time. 1222\", \" EQUITY RESEARCH QUARTERLY UPDATE January 27, 2016                                                                                 TECHNOLOGY/EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES Stock Rating: Apple Inc.

The company currently trades below its three-year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x; we believe the multiple is justified for its reduced revenue growth outlook (comparing to the past three years). KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 133\", \" EQUITY RESEARCH INDUSTRY UPDATE January 27, 2016 AAPL Supply Chain Derivatives SUMMARY TECHNOLOGY/SEMICONDUCTORS & COMPONENTS         Apple (covered by Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz) reported F1Q (Dec.) revenue of $75.9B vs. consensus $76.6B est. F2Q (Mar.) guidance of $51.5B (-32% Q/Q) was shy of the Street's $55.6B estimate. F1Q iPhone shipments of 74.8M units were 700K units below expectations. iPad shipments of 16.1M units were ~1.8M below expectations, marking the seventh consecutive quarter where iPads fell short. F2Q guidance implies ~50M iPhone units. We believe the magnitude of the weak quarter and guide was largely expected. We expect a muted reaction (a slight negative bias?) in the shares of Apple's semiconductor component suppliers Wednesday. Our top two picks within the AAPL supply chain remain AVGO and SWKS, driven by rising RF content and complexity. Near-term choppiness in the Apple supply chain could persist, though we believe the current levels represent a solid long-term SWKS/AVGO entry point. KEY POINTS â–\\xa0   C4Q iPhone units of 74.8M were below expectations of 75.5M. SWKS, one of our two favorite RF vendors (the other being AVGO), has ~20% higher content in IPh6s vs IPh6, while AVGO sees a more modest ~5% avg. gain. QRVO and CRUS were also big content winners. â–\\xa0   C4Q iPad units of 16.1M fell well shy of 17.9M estimates, likely due to an ongoing wallet shift toward larger format iPhones and longer tablet refresh cycles. Despite the miss, we contend long-term RF content growth in the higher unit iPhone ultimately offsets near-term concerns for those leveraged to the iPad, namely SWKS and AVGO. We would use near-term weakness as a buying opportunity. â–\\xa0   Total Mac sales of 5.3M units were below the Street's 5.8M estimate. The miss is unlikely to move the needle for INTC and NVDA given their more broad exposure to the fledgling PC market. We continue to believe consumers' wallet share is shifting toward iPhones and, to a lesser degree, iPads and away from PCs, favoring SWKS/AVGO/NXPI long term. â–\\xa0   AAPL revenue guidance of $51.5B (-32% Q/Q) was below the Street's $55.6B est. The miss is not surprising given recent commentary and cuts along the supply chain. We have already cut estimates and look to get better color as to the supplier- specific impact as these companies report over the coming weeks. We remain directionally bullish on SWKS/AVGO as their respective RF content stories remain intact for the foreseeable. â–\\xa0   We provide a full list of AAPL suppliers, p. 2. We continue to believe suppliers (AVGO, SWKS) with sustained content increase opportunities and substantial customer diversification (NXPI) are best positioned long term, and would use any weakness as a buying opportunity.

We believe iPhone growth can improve after March, as Y/Y comparisons get easier and Apple refreshes the 4\" iPhone. (2) Appleâ€™s Services business is even more attractive than we thought, with better than corporate average margin (we estimate 55% on a reported basis) and 15% revenue growth in F1Q16 accelerating from 10% in FY15 (excluding the $548M one- time payment), driven by the App Store, Apple Music, and Apple Pay. (3) India is a new focus. It is the third largest smartphone market with a young demographic (average age of 27) that tends to skew toward Apple products. Despite growing 48% in F1Q16, Apple\\'s revenue in the country is still very small. China is still the main growth driver, but expect to hear more about India over the next year. 4) Apple hedges its Chinese Yuan exposure. China accounted for 26% of revenue in the LTM and it is growing. With the Yuan depreciating against the USD, investors were concerned about the exposure.

We lower our FY16 EPS to $9 from $9.50. We lower FY16 revenue to $226.5B (-3% Y/Y) from $238.8B (+2%). We slightly lower iPhone units to 215.8M (-7% Y/Y) from 218.0M (-6%), and iPad units to 43.6M (-20%) from 44.5M (-19%). We also lower ASPs partially to take into account the stronger foreign currency headwinds. However, gross margin remains the same as hedging and component cost declines offset currency risk. Operating expenses are slightly lower though, at 12% Y/Y growth, we assume Apple continues to invest in future products and services.

We had actually thought that the ASP could be weaker due to mix shift toward the iPhone6 instead of the 6s. However, the iPhone ASP grew by $52 Y/Y in constant currency indicating a solid iPhone 6s/6s+ proportion in our opinion. Apple noted that the company also had a strong mid-tier with the 6/6+.

We believe this number is materially better than the â€˜low-70sâ€™ unit number that we believe many investors had thought was likely. Combined with the better ASP, overall iPhone revenue at $51.6bn was inline with our estimate. Adjusted Gross Margin in FQ1â€™16 was 40.0%, inline with our estimate, and GAAP gross margin at 40.1% was 0.2pp better than consensus. GAAP opex at $6.252m was 3% below consensus. Overall GAAP EPS at $3.28 was 1.6% better than consensus and adjusted EPS of $3.41 was 1.2% above our estimate.

AAPL, AAPL US Price: $99.44 FQ1'16 Preview: Cautious given slower buyback, 25 January 2016 supply chain weakness, poor macro data - ALERT ï‚· iPhone expectations lower: We are forecasting ~76m iPhone shipments in FQ1 (to                       Telecom & Networking Dec) and ~55m units in FQ2 (to Mar). We believe that general buy-side                                Equipment/IT Hardware expectations are in the low 70s for FQ1 and ~50m for FQ2. Based on our model,                        Rod Hall, CFA AC ~50m iPhones for FQ2 would translate into total revenue of ~$52bn (-10% Y/Y),                        (1-415) 315-6713 ~6% below our current estimate of $55.5bn and 6% below Bloomberg consensus of                        rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com ~$55.7bn.                                                                                            Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ï‚· China Mobile 4G net adds: 4G net adds momentum recovered at China Mobile Ashwin Kesireddy towards the end of FQ1. Net Adds grew 33% Y/Y in December, up from 19% in                            (1-415) 315-6756 November but below the 46% Y/Y in October.                                                           ashwin.x.kesireddy@jpmorgan.com J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ï‚· Lower repurchases: Between Oct 9 and Dec 28, we believe that Apple reduced its net share count by ~31m, implying a net repurchase of ~571k shares/trading day (in                   Rajagopal RK Raghunathan (1-415) 315-6760 ~54 trading days) vs. ~647k shares/workday last year (in ~61 trading days). We are rajagopal.raghunathan@jpmorgan.com slightly concerned that our total repurchase estimate of ~$7.5bn for FQ1 (+49%                       J.P. Morgan Securities LLC Y/Y) may turn out to be optimistic. Bala R Reddy ï‚· Asia supply chain indications: Our Asian supply chain analysts believe that build                    (91-22) 6157-3373 plans for FQ2 have likely stabilized in the 40-45m range now, down from 45-50m                       bala.reddy@jpmorgan.com J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in December. If correct we believe this would likely be due to higher inventory levels exiting FQ1. We note that 5 days during the holidays in 2015 fell into FQ2 vs. 4 days in 2014, and 3 days in 2013 â€“ thus exacerbating possible demand weakness but potentially then helping units in FQ2.                                                  Apple FQ1â€™16 PR: Aft-mkt (1:30pm PT/4:30pm ET) on ï‚· Weak Europe/US supply chain results: Beginning in October with Dialog and                            Tuesday, January 26 continuing right through January with weak reports from Qorvo, Cirrus Logic,                         Apple FQ1â€™16 Call: Multi-Fineline Electronix and ADI, the supply chain has been almost universally                      2pm PT/5pm ET on weak leading up to this report.                                                                      Tuesday, January 26 ï‚· ASP risk: We believe there is some risk to our $680 ASP estimate for the iPhone                      Dial in details: (866) 409-1555 (toll-free) given continued mix shift toward the lower-priced iPhone 6 away from the 6s.

This implies mid to high-40M iPhone shipments, down mid to high-30% Q/Q. We expect management to guide to relatively stable gross margins, in the 38.5% to 40% range from the past four quarters. Foreign currency has been a Q/Q headwind for the last two years and, based on QTD data, it will be a near 1% Q/Q headwind in the March quarter. We think Apple can offset some of this with component price declines, lower warranty accruals, and/or suppliers sharing currency gains. We believe a mix shift towards iPhone 6 (older version), larger screen sizes and larger memory capacities will largely offset the margin impact from lower iPhone volumes. Investor sentiment is more cautious than the consensus view of $56B of revenue, 40% gross margin and $2.25 EPS with roughly 52M iPhone units. We believe guidance of $50B to $52B in revenue and $1.90 to $2.00 in Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with EPS is a reasonable bogey. This implies about 46M iPhones shipments.

Finally, we see potential for unit upside in the June quarter with the introduction of the rumored 4\" iPhone, especially in emerging markets like India to capture more price conscious users. We don\\'t believe the new SKU is currently reflected in Apple consensus estimates. We see the stock bottoming in the mid-$90s assuming Appleâ€™s guidance is within lowered expectations. Investors now expect FY16 EPS of $8.50 or maybe slightly less. The low end of expectations for March quarter guidance as noted above would imply EPS $1.90, or 22% of $8.50 total FY16 EPS, which is in line with the last three years where March quarter has accounted for 22-25% of full year EPS. In addition, our Asia tech teamâ€™s preliminary estimate for iPhone builds in the June quarter is 40M, flat Q/Q vs. down mid to high-teens Q/Q in the last three June quarters, and points to improving seasonality after inventory adjustments in March. 2232', ' Apple, Inc. | January 13, 2016 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH MORGAN STANLEY & CO.

Looking at typical volumes of old generation iPhones in past cycles, 4â€ iPhone volumes could run in the 15M range. We donâ€™t believe the new SKU is included in March quarter production plans or in consensus Apple estimates. Assuming corporate average gross and operating margins, the new 4\" iPhone could add $0.25-0.30 of annual EPS, which more than offsets the potential for another 5M iPhone unit reduction (at higher ASP/margin) in-line with recent supply chain revisions. Net, we leave our FY16 iPhone unit and EPS estimates unchanged. Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

While overall smartphone 120 market growth has slowed in recent years, we continue to see good opportunities for Apple to gain market share in both 100 developed and emerging markets due to its significantly superior 80                                                                     user experience, human-computer interface, and premium 60                                                                     branding.

The company currently trades slightly below its three-year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x; we believe the multiple is justified for its reduced revenue growth outlook (comparing to the past three years). KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases.

Morgan India Private Limited Apple, overseeing custom silicon and hardware technologies including batteries, application processors, storage controllers, sensors silicon, display silicon and other chipsets across Appleâ€™s entire product line. We see proprietary semiconductor design as a key element of the companyâ€™s ability to continue to differentiate its products in the future. ï‚· Phil Schiller takes over App Store: Phil Schiller, SVP of Worldwide marketing, is expanding his role to App Stores across all platforms. Apple said that Phil now leads nearly all developer-related functions at Apple, in addition to his other marketing responsibilities, including Worldwide Product Marketing, international marketing, education and business marketing. The increased App Store focus is clearly needed, in our opinion, with recent criticisms of the Mac App Store in particular being at issue. We also believe the Apple TV App store offers significant potential and deserves additional management attention. ï‚· Tor Myhren named new VP of Marketing Communications: Apple said Tor Myhren will join Apple in CQ1â€™16 as VP of Marketing Communications. Mr. Myhren will succeed Hiroki Asai, who plans to retire after 18 years in graphic design and marketing communications roles at Apple.

We see a return to growth in September 2016 as the large base of new users added during the iPhone 6 cycle begin to upgrade. We also see potential upside to our forecast if Apple decides to launch the rumored new 4â€ iPhone which suppliers expect to begin building in the March time frame (see Potential Launch of 4\" iPhone Model published December 1, 2015). A smaller device is likely to capture more price conscious users, particularly in emerging markets like India. Positive mix shift partially offsets unit weakness and reflects Appleâ€™s strong competitive position. We see a number of mix factors driving ASP and margin upside: 1) mix shift to larger screens, with the 5.5\" iPhones accounting    Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with for 40% of US purchase intentions in October 2015 vs. 23% in December 2014         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Why this is different than 2012-13? 1) Apple remains a share gainer, though in a weaker overall growth environment. iPhone gained 2.4 points of unit share LTM versus losing 3.6 points of share in 2013. Our survey data points to record share gains in 2016, specifically eight points in the US and two points in China (Exhibits 5 and 6). 2) Gross margin risk is limited. In 2012 Apple gross margin peaked at 47% followed by a trough of 37% in 2013. We donâ€™t see similar volatility given favorable component costs and positive iPhone mix shifts that will help expand ASPs. 3) Appleâ€™s large cash return policy, with buybacks adding five points of EPS growth in FY16 vs. one point in FY13. Strong cash generation should maintain this earnings tailwind going forward with repatriation a wildcard that could accelerate the pace of buybacks and/or accretive M&A. 4) New markets, like Autos, represent meaningful addressable market expansion. 3102 Apple, Inc. | December 13, 2015 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH Risk Reward World\\'s Most Valuable Technology Platform Enhanced by New Devices and Services $ 200 Investment Thesis $189.00 (+67%) 180                                                                                                                                                                   Apple has the world\\'s most valuable technology platform, and we believe it is best positioned to 160 capture more of their users\\' time in areas such as 140                                                                                                                       $143.00 (+26%) health, autos and home, as these platforms expand 120                                                                                   $113.18                                                                         in the Internet of Things computing era.

Along with the slowing market, iPhone is expected to decelerate (we model +7% Y/Y, down from +37% in FY15) but suppliers expect it to fare better than competitors in light of leading innovation, brand, and customer loyalty. As a result some suppliers plan capacity expansions to support growth next year. Camera and Force Touch key innovation in iPhone 7. Suppliers expect modest improvements like waterproof components and improved casing design but dual camera, which can solve for 3D, autofocus, or low light conditions, and improved Force Touch technology with expanded use cases (like gaming) are currently expected to be the differentiating features in iPhone 7. Autos becoming a focus for smartphone suppliers. As component suppliers look for the next growth engine, they're shifting focus to autos, engaging both existing brands and potential new entrants. Suppliers see many opportunities to leverage smartphone expertise such as in cameras, sensors, batteries, and displays. Given the changing supply chain as the industry transitions to electric from transmission powered vehicles and eventually to autonomous, we see the opportunity for technology vendors, including Google and Apple , to dominate. Component suppliers see new wearables categories like head mounted displays, as further away than the auto opportunity. Asian enterprises adopting of new data center technologies.

This mix shift toward high-end phones supports our view that Apple is converting the mid-market smartphone installed base to iOS. Apple shipments in China grew 150% Y/Y compared to overall market growth of 4% (though there is some benefit from an earlier launch this cycle, shifting some units into 3Q). Even excluding the lift from iPhones, the overall high-end market ($300+) outgrew the overall market at 8% Y/Y. ASPs in the country rose 18% Y/Y in 3Q, and excluding Apple, ASPs grew 3%. We believe this trend reflects a bias toward higher-end devices as smartphone usage matures and upgraders opt to trade up to larger, more powerful handsets with advanced ecosystems. IDC data is consistent with our AlphaWise October survey results, which showed nearly two-thirds of Chinese smartphone users are willing to                          Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with spend more on their next device - a function of LTE adoption and the                         companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research.

Mobile device usage continues to grow as ownership penetration matures, driving iOS share gains.                         North America IndustryView                                               Cautious Exhibit 1: Apple and Huawei Gained Share, Consistent with Recent AlphaWise Survey So u rce: IDC, Mo rgan Stan ley Research IDC\\'s 3Q15 smartphone shipments of 355.2M units missed our estimates by 3.7%, growing 6.8% Y/Y vs MSe 11%. The weakness was attributed to new Android flagship introductions from several top-tier OEMs underperforming and \"slightly lower than expected iPhone shipments,\" consistent with Apple results (iPhone units missed our estimates by 1M, or 2%). Market share trends consistent with our AlphaWise surveys. Apple and Huawei were the only share gainers with Samsung holding unit share relatively flat. While market growth is slowing, Apple\\'s December quarter guidance implies iPhone unit and revenue growth on the back of 1) strength in emerging markets, including China, 2) continued upgrade cycle, with 69% of users yet to upgrade to larger screens, 3) record Android share gains, and 4) ASP uplift. Each of these factors should continue as iOS takes share in a maturing smartphone market. Our data also indicate Chinese users shifting to better smartphones and more US users plan to upgrade this year than last year. As a result, Apple is expected to take record share in the its two largest countries in 2016.

We believe NetApp could report revenue and EPS below our model of $1.42B and $0.56 and consensus of $1.43B and $0.57. We expect branded revenue to decline 7% Y/Y in the October quarter, following -9% Y/Y in the July quarter. We see risk to the company\\'s guidance for greater than normal seasonality during the quarter (2-3pts above 3-year average) as our C3Q15 channel checks suggest NetApp continues to underperform other storage vendors in the channel. While several companies highlighted weakness in traditional enterprise markets (EMC, IBM) during the quarter, we believe NetApp faces additional company specific pressures given a weaker product portfolio and departure of sales people. We also see downside risk to guidance as our estimates and consensus call for in-line to slightly better seasonality in the next two quarters. We believe the secular shift away from on-premise storage, increasing competitive pressure from flash-based start-ups, and company specific factors create a headwind for NTAP to return to normalized seasonality. For the January quarter, we think our revenue estimate of $1.48B (-4% Y/Y branded growth) will be near the high-end of the guidance range. We model FY16 operating margin falling to 9.8% as OpEx declines only 2% Y/Y compared to revenue declines of 6% Y/Y due to investments to expand the companyâ€™s go-to-market capacity and account coverage. NMBL Nimble is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, November 19th, after market close. We expect revenue and EPS in-line to slightly above our forecast of $87.7M and -$0.08 and consensus estimates of $87.4M and -$0.08. Our conversations with the channel continue to indicate strong demand for flash-related storage, where we believe Nimble remains a leader in the hybrid flash market. Additionally, data from our CIO survey suggests Nimble will be one of the biggest beneficiaries from the migration towards flash-based storage. We model gross margin of 67.2% and expect Nimble to continue to exceed its long-term guidance (63%-65%), similar to recent quarters. We expect management continued to invest heavily ahead of its target of reaching non-GAAP earnings profitability in the Jan â€™16 quarter (F4Q16). Therefore, EPS may be in-line to slightly better than MSe and consensus (both -$0.08). We remain Overweight NMBL and believe the company is on track to reach operating income breakeven by the end of the calendar year. We expect the company to guide F4Q16 revenue in-line with our estimate of $99.1M and breakeven EPS, which is in-line with consensus ($99.2M and breakeven EPS). We see Nimble maintaining Y/Y growth in the 50% range near-term and north of 40% next year as a broader product allows the company to compete in a wider set of workloads, and Fibre Channel aids enterprise adoption and larger deal sizes. 3502 Tech Hardware Insights | November 12, 2015 MORGAN STANLEY RESEARCH Comparison of Morgan Stanley Estimates vs Consensus Exhibit 2: NetApp Ticker                                NTAP                                                                                                  Kathryn Huberty Industry View                         Cautious                                                                                              212-761-6249 Stock Rating                          Underweight                                                                                           kathryn.huberty@morganstanley.com F3Q16 and FY16 Expectations Consensus (before call): F3Q16 revenue of $1.48B and non-GAAP EPS of $0.70, FY16 revenue of $5.80B and non-GAAP EPS of $2.32.

Note this capital expenditure number differs from the cash number Apple reports in its cash flow statement, but it is a good indication of revenue with 80% correlation. The spend extrapolates to $252B of revenue in FY16, or 3% above consensus. Apple\\'s capital expenditure tends to grow faster during years when iPhones with new form factors launch (numbered cycles), and FY16 is no different as spending growth of 34% accelerates from 2%, or $11.2B in FY15. We understand the increase in FY16 comes from three areas: product tooling and manufacturing process equipment (e.g. production capacity), data center capacity as Apple is increasing the number of Internet services it provides to a growing user base, and construction for the new campus as it is nearing completion in FY16.

In the last few Dec Qs, warranty accruals    report. as a portion of revenue is roughly flat Q/Q if there is no major form factor 3781 Apple, Inc. | November 2, 2015 change (s-cycle) like this year, while it is up about one point Q/Q in Dec Qs with new form factors (numbered cycle). Apple should recoup over time some of the up front expenses it incurs for the iPhone Upgrade Program. The company has two additional expenses with this program: a cost for the interest free financing that a third- party bank is providing, and an accounting expense as Apple assumes the expected resell value of the returned iPhone is less than the outstanding loan balance. When a user returns his/her iPhone and gets a new one, Apple has to pay off the loan balance on the returned iPhone and resell it (through a third- party reseller). We actually think the program is better for Apple over time since (1) it does not have to sell iPhones to wireless providers at a discount, (2) Apple\\'s program has 100% AppleCare+ attach rate, and (3) refurbished iPhones are selling at prices where Apple is likely to end up realizing gains instead of expenses. From the filing: \"The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.\" The company is stepping up its advertising. Advertising expense was $1.8B in FY15, up 50% Y/Y and accelerating from 7-10% growth in the prior three years. With large screen iPhones, Apple Watch, MacBook, Pay and Music, Apple had many new products to communicate to users last year. Samsung\\'s advertising spending still dwarfs Apple at $3.3B in CY14 but it was -9% Y/Y, and it is -6% in C1H15. Indirect brand advertising created by Apple-owned retail stores explains the lower direct spend versus Samsung. 3792', \" North America Equity Research 30 October 2015 Overweight Apple Inc.                                                                                             AAPL, AAPL US Price: $120.53 FQ4 10-K Review: Accounting changes boost margins 29 October 2015 while product deferred revenue keeps growing - ALERT Based on Appleâ€™s disclosures in its 10-K, we believe that the companyâ€™s change in                      Telecom & Networking accounting for deferred revenue on iPhones/iPads/Macs and for warranty accruals are                    Equipment/IT Hardware both positive for gross margins going forward. We also note continued growth in                        Rod Hall, CFA AC product deferred revenue in FQ4â€™15. We continue to believe that macro worries are                      (1-415) 315-6713 likely to keep the stock from performing at the end of this year but on a longer horizon               rod.b.hall@jpmorgan.com we believe Apple offers solid return potential here for the patient investor.                          Bloomberg JPMA HALL <GO> Ashwin Kesireddy ï‚· Warranty accrual declines: We note that warranty accruals dropped from FQ3â€™s                         (1-415) 315-6756 level of $1,071m to $893m in FQ4. We believe this was due to a reassessment of                       ashwin.x.kesireddy@jpmorgan.com product quality and subsequent reduction in actuarial assumptions related to                         J.P. Morgan Securities LLC breakage/failure. We note that this reduction should benefit gross margins going forward assuming a lower average accrual per device at the time of sale. ï‚· Deferred Revenue change enhances margins: Apple reduced the ESP (Estimated Selling Price) for software upgrade rights and non-software services on iOS devices and Macs by $5-$10 in September. ESPs were previously $15-$25 for iPhone and iPad and $40 for Mac according to Apple. We estimate that the lower ESP should increase overall gross margin by about 40bps in FQ1â€™16 and FY16. ï‚· Growing Purchase Commitments: Apple's purchase commitments grew 20% or $5bn Y/Y to $29.5bn. The growth in purchase commitments was down from 41% Y/Y in FQ2â€™15, but the Q/Q growth picked up to $7.8bn, following $2.7bn Q/Q growth in FQ3â€™15. ï‚· FX derivatives: We estimate that FX derivatives benefitted Appleâ€™s gross margin by 0.7pp in FQ4â€™15. By proportionately allocating revenue hedge gains we estimate that underlying ASPs for iPhone would have been up by $13 Q/Q vs. the $10 reported. ï‚· Hiring increases: Apple hired 17,400 full-time employees in FY15, up from 12,300 in FY14. Total headcount as of the end of FY15 was 110k. ï‚· $15bn FYâ€™16 Capex: Apple stated that they plan ~$15.0bn in capex for FY16 (+32% Y/Y), which includes retail store facilities, well above our current forecast of $10.1bn. This represents a cape/sales increase from 4.8% in FY15 to 6.1% in F16 on our current revenue forecasts. ï‚· Regional growth color: Based on Appleâ€™s disclosures Mac grew in all regions in FY15 while iPhones grew in all regions except Japan. ï‚· Reduced disclosure around services: The company stated that Services now combines five categories â€“ Internet Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Licensing and others. We believe that Internet Services is the old iTunes Store Revenue and Licensing was included in the old Software/services group. Apple stopped disclosing Internet Services revenue separately which includes iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, iBooks Store and Apple Music. ï‚· FX VAR Increases: Based on the companyâ€™s value-at-risk (VAR) model, Apple estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342m as of FY15 end vs. $240m at the end of FY14.

While a small portion of the ASP      e = Morgan Stanley Research estim ates lift in the September quarter was a function of lower deferred revenue, iPhone ASP rose 11% Y/Y and 1% Q/Q, above our 6% forecast. Similarly, iPad and Mac ASPs were better than expected even after adjusting for the lower deferrals. Our data on iPhone mix points to flat ASPs in FY16 compared to our forecast for -3%. The $5 lower deferral on iOS devices and $10 lower on Macs provide an additional ASP boost through FY16. All regions saw strong iPhone demand. Europe revenue grew 18% Y/Y at constant currency (vs. +2% reported) with strong underlying iPhone demand in Germany, Italy, France, Spain and India despite mixed third-party data. All this despite Europe having less distribution for the new iPhone in the quarter compared to last year, the opposite of China. Japan saw 29% constant currency revenue growth and APAC 49%.

We believe currency is partially offset by lower revenue deferrals (costs are always expensed) and better iPhone 6 margins as the product benefits from further component cost declines. While March quarter remains at the center of the bear debate, our work highlighted above, suggests growth will carry into next calendar year. Management remains confident that long-term trends remain favorable. When asked about future iPhone growth prospects, CEO Tim Cook noted the growth of China's middle class and low LTE adoption as key drivers. He also points to smartphone installment and leasing programs from Apple and wireless providers that will shorten iPhone replacement cycles and create a more subscription-like instead of transactional business for Apple. 4072\", \" North America Equity Research 28 October 2015 Overweight Apple Inc.

We believe F1Q16 guidance and management comment will alleviate investors' concerns about peaking iPhone shipment in a weak macro environment. â–\\xa0   Bottom Line: Our thesis on Apple is unchanged. This quarter proves again that Apple's widening platform advantages and superior user experience will maintain its share gain over competition and growth from emerging market customers.

The company currently trades slightly below its three-year median FY1E P/E of 12.7x; we believe the multiple is justified for its slightly reduced revenue growth outlook (comparing to the past three years) and our projected annual EPS growth of over 10% per year. KEY RISKS 1) Apple's growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple's size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases. Andrew Uerkwitz: 212 667-5316 2 434\", \" EQUITY RESEARCH INDUSTRY UPDATE October 28, 2015 AAPL Supply Chain Derivatives SUMMARY TECHNOLOGY/SEMICONDUCTORS & COMPONENTS            AAPL (covered by Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz) reported F4Q (Sept.) revenue of $51.5B vs. consensus' $51B est. F1Q (Dec.) guidance of $76.5B (+49% Q/Q) was just shy of the Street's $76.8B estimate. iPhone shipments of 48.1M units were in line with expectations, while iPad shipments of 9.9M units were ~500,000 below expectations, marking the sixth consecutive quarter where iPads fell short. With sentiment having soured for much of the Apple supply chain over the past several weeks, we expect the better than expected results and positive commentary surrounding iPhone demand in China to result in a relief rally for many of the component suppliers. Our top two picks within the AAPL supply chain remain AVGO and SWKS, driven by higher levels of RF front-end complexity. We would use any near-term weakness as a buying opportunity. Similarly, CRUS should see a nice lift given higher content and better units. KEY POINTS â–\\xa0   C3Q iPhone units of 48.1M were in line with expectations. SWKS, one of our two favorite RF vendors (the other being AVGO), benefits from ~20% higher content in IPh6s vs IPh6, while AVGO sees a more modest 5% gain. QRVO was also a big winner, having secured the high-band PAD in several high-volume SKUs. Similarly, CRUS saw major content growth gen/gen (up over 25% to $3-plus) with its new 55nm smart codec, and should trade up on the better unit numbers. â–\\xa0   C3Q iPad units of 9.9M fell short of 10.5M estimate, likely due to an ongoing wallet shift toward larger format iPhones and longer tablet refresh cycles. Despite the miss, we contend long-term RF-content growth in the higher-unit iPhone ultimately offsets near-term concerns for those leveraged to the iPad, namely SWKS and AVGO. We would use near-term weakness as a buying opportunity. â–\\xa0   Total Mac sales of 5.7M units modestly exceeded the Street's 5.65M estimate, but is unlikely to move the needle for INTC and NVDA given their more broad exposure to the fledgling PC market. We continue to believe consumers' wallet share is shifting toward iPhones and, to a lesser degree, iPads and away from PCs, favoring SWKS/AVGO/NXPI long-term. â–\\xa0   AAPL revenue guidance of $51.5B (+3% Q/Q) was just modestly ahead of the Street's $51B est. While the modest beat is nice, investors continue to intensely focus on company-specific content gains, and the likelihood of sustaining that momentum in successive generations. We look to get better color as these companies report over the coming weeks and remain directionally positive on SWKS/AVGO as RF content remains on the rise for the foreseeable. â–\\xa0   We provide a full list of AAPL suppliers, p., 2. We expect a positive reaction from the supply chain on Wednesday given the better than expected results in the face of deteriorating sentiment over the last several weeks. We continue to believe suppliers (AVGO, SWKS) with sustained content increase opportunities and substantial customer diversification (NXPI) are best positioned long term, and would use any weakness as a buying opportunity.

After the                  Telecom & Networking unexpected weak Dialog Semi guidance on Monday we believe the setup into earnings                      Equipment/IT Hardware is mixed. Given weak macro we believe cautious guidance for FQ1 to December is                         Rod Hall, CFA AC likely but this is now at least partially (though probably not completely) discounted.

Morgan Securities LLC 28th. Weak guidance for Dialogâ€™s Q4 implies Mobile Systems Y/Y revenue growth of ~0% in Q4 after 18% growth in Q3. After adjusting for lead times, we estimate that DLGâ€™s Q4 revenue guidance implies ~7% Y/Y growth in revenue related to                          Apple FQ4â€™15 PR: Apple. We believe this implies ~2.5% Y/Y decline in iPhone units based on our                        Aft-mkt (1:30pm PT/4:30pm ET) on Tuesday, October 27 assumption of 8.5% Y/Y ASP growth for DLG. We note that the range of possible outcomes here is wide though the implication is incrementally negative.                              Apple FQ4â€™15 Call: 2pm PT/5pm ET on Tuesday, October ï‚· Cautious FQ1 guidance anticipated. We believe that global demand for the iPhone                      27 6/6S and 6+/6s+ remains strong. We are forecasting 47.6m iPhone shipments in FQ3 (+21% Y/Y) and 75.5m in FQ4 (+1% Y/Y). While macro data remains mixed to                             Dial in details: (888) 710-4022 (toll-free) slightly positive, we believe that Apple will likely guide conservatively given recent               (913) 312-1442 negative data points. ï‚· FX headwinds: FX impact on Appleâ€™s total revenue on a Y/Y basis is a headwind for FQ4â€™15, in our opinion. We believe that FX will continue to be a factor in FQ1â€™16 on a Y/Y basis as well. Using FX rates up to this point and assuming spot rates going forward we estimate Y/Y depreciation of 13% for the EUR, 6% for the JPY, 30% for the RUB and 52% for the BRL. In FQ1â€™15, FX had a negative 4pp impact on Y/Y revenue growth according to Apple. This is similar to the blended ~4% impact we current calculate for Appleâ€™s revenue this FQ1. ï‚· Apple Watch reviews: We are forecasting 9m Watch shipments in FY15, growing to 47m in FY16. We hope for some indication of Watch units from Apple today though we suspect the company will refrain from providing this data. ï‚· iPad shipments to decline: We expect another weak iPad quarter from Apple. We are forecasting 10.59m iPad shipments in FQ4 and 19.71m in FQ1â€™16. ï‚· Mac share flat: We are forecasting 4.69m Mac shipments in FQ4. We are currently expecting the Mac to lose a slight 0.2pp share Y/Y in FQ4. ï‚· FQ4â€™15 estimates/guidance/consensus: For FQ4â€™15, we are forecasting total revenue of $50.71bn (cons: $51.02bn, guid: $49-51bn), gross margin of 39.2% (cons: 39.3%, guid: 38.5-39.5%), opex of $5.93bn (cons: $5.88bn, guid: $5.85- 5.95bn), EBIT margin of 27.5% (cons: 27.8%), and EPS of $1.84 (cons: $1.88). ï‚· FQ1â€™16 estimates/consensus: For FQ1â€™16, we forecast total revenue of $81.34bn (cons: $77.05bn), gross margin of 38.8% (cons: 39.7%), opex of $6.41bn (cons: $6.16bn), EBIT margin of 30.9% (cons: 31.7%), and EPS of $3.30 (cons: $3.20).

We expect Apple to guide similar to past quarters, or slightly below consensus implying slight iPhone growth at the mid-point. In the last 10 quarters, the mid-point of Apple's revenue guidance has been 3% lower than consensus though during the 6 cycle it was 1% lower. This implies revenue range of $74B to $76B in the December quarter, or up 50% Q/Q, which is close to 54% in FY13 and 52% in FY12 before the 6 cycle. We expect management to message stable gross margin, similar to recent quarters, with a range of 38.5% to 39.5% most likely. Consensus models $77B of revenue, 39.7% gross margin and $3.21 of EPS with roughly 76M iPhones. We see upside to December quarter revenue driven by iPhone demand. We model 79M iPhones (+6% Y/Y) for the quarter and 248M (+7%) for FY16, based on our recent AlphaWise surveys in the US and China, which indicate Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with purchase intention share gains (Exhibits 2 and 3).

Investors should consider Morgan target, and never got higher than that through the last iPhone cycle.

This means ASPs could      report. be flat Y/Y in FY16, though we model -3% to be conservative, and -5% in the 4691 Apple, Inc. | October 23, 2015 December quarter. Net, we model $78.9B of revenue in the quarter, consistent with the level of upside over the past two years. Reported revenue has been 6% higher than the mid-point of guidance in the last 10 quarters, and 9% higher in the 6 cycle. Several factors suggest potential gross margin upside going forward, though we do not expect a significant step up in December quarter guidance, if any. (1) Increasing mix of iPhones and Accessories, including Watch, and lower mix of Macs and iPads. (2) Improving iPhone 6s and 6s Plus and Watch margins as they ramp. (3) We estimate iPhone 6 gross margins should be close to 6s, as component cost declines over the last year offsets the $100 price decrease on the 6. (4) Apple raised prices in certain regions in the last two quarters to offset foreign currency headwinds, and asked suppliers to share their FX gains. While the price increases will impact demand in the Eurozone, Russia, etc., it should help margins, which have been under FX pressure in the last 12 months. (5) Increasing AppleCare (extended warranty) attach rate as iPhone Upgrade Program (100% attach) gains subscribers. Weak sentiment, potential positive revisions, and below industry valuation provides an attractive set-up . Investors are concerned December quarter iPhone shipments could be down Y/Y, and even if not, March quarter is another tough Y/Y comparison. We expect iPhone unit - and possibly ASP and margin - upside to change that view in the next two quarters. Valuation remains low at 11x our CY16 EPS estimate of $10.80 or 8x ex-net cash. Apple's FCF was 25% higher than net income the last two years, and that gap should widen as Apple offers more services. On EV/FCF, Apple is trading at 7x CY16 FCF, lower than large cap Tech Hardware at 10x. 4702\", \" North America Equity Research 11 October 2015 Overweight Apple Inc.

Price Performance ï‚· CQ4 revised up: Based on supply chain checks from our Asian colleagues (note                            130 here), we believe Apple has revised up CQ4 iPhone build plans by almost 5m units                         120 $ 110 to 75m-80m from 70m-75m probably driven by solid iPhone 6s/6s+ demand. In the 100 case of the 6s+ order lead times have pushed out, suggesting demand may be tilting 90 in that direction more than Apple expected.

Apple\\'s closing price of $111.31 on Oct. 6th reflects less than 9x FY16E EPS ex-cash, an unjustified position given the quality of the company and better than ever competitive position. Our $155 price target is based on 12.5x FY16E EPS of $10.47 plus $25 per share cash. â–\\xa0   Bottom Line: We believe fear over Apple\\'s growth challenge is exaggerated. We see Apple (especially the iPhone) continuing to benefit from two secular trends in consumer electronics: 1) upgrade to premium, life-style focusing products in developing countries, and 2) evolving device ecosystems that favor tight hardware-software integration and superior user experience.

The company currently trades slightly above its three-year median FY2E P/E of 11.5x; we believe AAPL deserves a premium multiple based on its refreshed product cycle, strengthened ecosystem, and upbeat prospects on new products. KEY RISKS 1) Apple\\'s growth is more dependent on the iPhone. We are concerned about investors\\' reaction to significant slowdown of iPhone Y/Y growth in FY16. 2) Apple\\'s size leaves it vulnerable to constant regulator oversight and the legal costs and uncertainty that come with it. As it expands its market presence in emerging countries, political risk also increases.

We expect it to be 100% electric, eventually autonomous and ultimately offered as a service in a shared mobility model. When thinking about all of the companies in our coverage universe, we offer high level observations on the content that is most/least likely to find itself in the Apple Car. Readers may notice that, with only a few exceptions, most firms under our coverage have a limited or diminished role in what we envision an Apple Car to be. Note: Apple has not commented on any developments relating to a potential \"Apple Car,\" although recent press reports in The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere have suggested such a car could be under development. The views captured below are entirely based on a hypothetical construct of an Apple Car, and our own broad assessment of potential relevance to our coverage companies. Well-positioned: o Delphi. A Tier-0 â€˜mega supplierâ€™ with the chops to make an Audi Q5 cross the continental United States without a driver. Many aspects of Delphiâ€™s product portfolio could make it onto a potential Apple Car (ADAS, connectors, electrical distribution), but not all of it (injection systems/timing systems). o Lear. An Apple Car will likely have an increased emphasis on the passenger (not the driver) experience. This includes seats and complete interiors. Electrical architectures may be due for a wholesale rethink, but much of Learâ€™s product offering has a surprising level of relevance in an Apple Car, arguably even more important than in a conventional automobile, as comfort becomes an even more integral part of the mobility experience. o Magna. A variety of tech players want to get into the car business, but we donâ€™t think they want to make cars in their own factories. We anticipate the contract manufacturing model to eventually account for the vast majority of            Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with global auto production. Magnaâ€™s Steyr business (vehicle assembly) is the               companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, closest thing to the Foxconn of autos, in our view. The firmâ€™s other products          investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan (seating, doors, body, electronics) also represent potentially relevant content.

Our FY2019 Apple Car scenario assumes a $55,000 ASP and 200K shipments, yielding an EPS benefit of ~$0.32. When paired with a forward P/E of ~10x this contributes ~$3 to the AAPL stock price. Introducing FY19 Apple Car â€œBlue Skyâ€ Scenario Our 2019 Apple Car scenario (Chart 2) which assumes 200K Apple Car shipments at an ASP of $55,000 and OPM of 20% suggests that 1) Car is capable of moving the EPS needle for Apple, but requires the realization of scale benefits and assumes that Appleâ€™s premium brand would extend to the Car, 2) Apple would find it difficult to reproduce its ~30% Source: Jefferies                                  iPhone-driven OPM profile in Car, and 3) even after a Car is potentially introduced, iPhone would remain a significant if not majority driver of OP and EPS.

We do think the prospect of an Apple Car is interesting and could ultimately make us more constructive on the stock. While the stockâ€™s decline over recent weeks has made it incrementally more attractive to us, we decided not to upgrade our rating because 1) we continue to believe structural iPhone risk is still not fully baked into the stock price, and 2) while mainstream media over the last few months have discussed the possibility of Apple introducing a Car, we donâ€™t think investors are assigning a high probability to such an event, in part due to nervousness around potential transition to a lower-margin business. page 4 of 68                                                                              Sundeep Bajikar, Equity Analyst, (415) 229-1552, sbajikar@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 64 - 68 of this report. 525 AAPL Estimate Change September 23, 2015 We would like to see investor concerns in both areas dissipate to a greater extent before we can aggressively recommend buying AAPL stock.

Upside Risks: Apple could invent a new type of fuel source for Cars with better economics than our forecasts. Smartphone competition (primarily Samsung Electronics, Huawei and Xiaomi) misexecutes, allowing iPhone to continue to outperform for longer than investors expect.

Our FY16 Base Case assumes 228.5m iPhones, 25m Apple Watches, and services revenues of $23.6B. Our FY16 Base Case EPS estimate of $9.71 remains unchanged, and is roughly in line with Street estimates. Our FY16 Bull Case assumes 247m iPhones, 32.5m Apple Watches, and services revenues of $24.1B. Our FY16 Bear Case assumes 178m iPhones, 17m Apple Watches, and services revenues of $22.1B. Our FY19 Apple Car scenario assumes 200K shipments at an average price of $55,000 per car for revenues of $11B. Even after applying a 20% OPM, we think Apple Car would only contribute $0.32 of EPS. Our analysis indicates both the continued risk associated with and importance of iPhone.

Google started its Car development in 2009, and at this point has completed over 1m miles of road- testing, which represents ~75 years of driving experience. We believe Google is working with major auto part suppliers such as Roush, Bosch, Continental, FRIMO, LG Electronics, Prefix, RCO, ZF Lenksysteme, etc. We believe Google plans to enable a number of third party car makers with its technology for self-driving cars. Consistent with Googleâ€™s prior efforts with Android for example, we expect Google to target expansion of its core business model of search advertising using the Car as its new platform.

In addition to a fundamental shift to an electric powertrain, Google Car is equipped with a variety of advanced sensors and computing technology. We believe Google Car is capable of driving itself without human intervention (aka â€œautonomous navigationâ€), and is designed with the goal of enabling broader deployment of autonomous navigation. We believe Google is using a combination of advanced computer vision, high-definition mapping, and redundant sensors like RADAR and LIDAR to enable autonomous navigation.

In our view, Googleâ€™s existing ~25 car prototype fleet is not eventually destined for production. We donâ€™t think Google intends to sell cars, although this could certainly change over time. Rather, we believe the prototype fleet exists merely as a development, testing, and proof-of-concept platform. We think it is more likely that Google would sell its software (and perhaps sensors) to the auto manufacturers, who would integrate Googleâ€™s solution into their own vehicles. This strategy would be much more in-line with the standard Google playbook of developing useful software that is designed to become ubiquitous. This is the same strategy Google has used to pursue the smartphone / hardware market to-date. Remember, Google has dabbled (to the tune of $12.5B) in hardware before with Motorola, and we believe it is not in Googleâ€™s core competency to produce cars at scale. Even Googleâ€™s â€˜referenceâ€™ Nexus devices are outsourced to a 3rd party like LG. Google is currently testing their Chart 8: Google Self-Driving Car Project Timeline and Data Points technology in Mountain View, Date            Update California and Austin, Texas.                      2009            Google started testing their self-driving technology with the Toyota Prius on freeways in California. 2012            Google began testing with the Lexus RX450h. At this point, they had completed over 300,000 miles of testing on freeways. 2012+           Google shifted focus to city streets, a much more complex environment than freeways. 2014            Google unveiled an early construction of their new prototype vehicle. Itâ€™s designed from the ground up to be fully self-driving. December 2014   Delivered the first real build of their prototype vehicle. Googleâ€™s self-driving fleet consists of the following vehicles: ï‚§     23 Lexus RX450h SUVs â€“ currently self-driving on public streets in Mountain View and Austin. ï‚§     25 prototype cars â€“ 5 are currently self-driving on public streets in Mountain View Miles driven single start of Googleâ€™s project in 2009: ï‚§     Autonomous mode: 1,158,818 miles ï‚§     Manual mode: 877,477 miles ï‚§     Currently averaging 10K autonomous miles per week on public streets.

The system uses advanced sensors (lasers, radars, and cameras), which are designed to detect objects as far as two football fields away in all directions, including pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles â€“ or even things like fluttering plastic bags and rogue birds. But the secret sauce is in the software, which is not a surprise given Googleâ€™s prowess in this area. For example, bicycles are treated as a special category of moving object. Google can identify cyclist hand signals, which allow the car to predict lane changes. Additionally, the car is designed to handle many other unique situations like construction zones and emergency vehicles. For example, when Google detects an ambulance approaching an intersection the car will remain stopped even though the light turned green.

We assume auto makers sell roughly ~90MM units worldwide, growing to ~103MM by 2018. We are particularly interested in the number of cars sold into the developed world, and we run a sensitivity analysis around the percent of developed market cars that could license Google technology. Additionally, our sensitivity assumes a per-car license fee between $100 and $1,000. Using this, our base case revenue impact is $790MM in 2017, growing to $2.0B by2018.

Googleâ€™s public commentary suggests its primary interest might be in enabling third party car makers to make more advanced cars capable of autonomous navigation. In other words, Google does not seem to be interested in building its own Cars; but that could change over time. We believe Car represents a â€œmulti-screenâ€ opportunity for Apple (and Google) to capture greater consumer mindshare and wallet share, and Apple would be unlikely to ignore the Car threat from Google. Lack of presence in Car could start to loosen the grip Apple currently enjoys over consumers, with iOS. We also believe that incumbent premium car makers including BMW, Daimler, Audi, and Tesla are accelerating their plans to introduce Electric Vehicles capable of autonomous navigation, driven in part by potential threats from Apple and Google. We think this means Apple is working against the clock to some extent, if it wants to take credit for bringing truly revolutionary changes to the Car market. page 12 of 68                                                                           Sundeep Bajikar, Equity Analyst, (415) 229-1552, sbajikar@jefferies.com Please see important disclosure information on pages 64 - 68 of this report. 533 AAPL Estimate Change September 23, 2015 iPhone is Maturing, Investors are Nervous The chart shows Trending data from Chart 16: Google Trends: iPhone Product Cycle comparison ex-China Google Trends, comparing consumer interest in iPhone 6s with that for iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s. 100 iPhone 6 Given Googleâ€™s limited presence in                                           90                                     iPhone interest ex- China, we think the data are                                                                                          China declining probably not fully capturing Chinese 80 consumer interest in iPhone.                                                 70 Relative Weighting 60                                                                              iPhone 5 Trending data show a potentially troubling trend both for major and                                           50 minor (â€œsâ€) iPhone launches, with interest levels declining.                                                   40 iPhone 4s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                iPhone 6s 30                                                                                                                                       iPhone 5s 20 10 0 2010-09-26 2011-01-16 2011-05-08 2011-08-28 2011-12-18 2012-04-08 2012-07-29 2012-11-18 2013-03-10 2013-06-30 2013-10-20 2014-02-09 2014-06-01 2014-09-21 2015-01-11 2015-05-03 2015-08-23 Source: Google Trends (ex-China), Jefferies This chart shows that cumulative                   Chart 17: iPhone Cumulative Interest Peaked in 2012 ex-China consumer interest in iPhone ex-China peaked in 2012, around the launch                   100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          iP. 6 of iPhone 5.

On its website, the DMV indicates it has already issued permits to 10 companies to test these vehicles, including most recently Honda and BMW. This Guardian report follows another one about a month ago stating that Apple met with GoMentum Station, a testing ground for autonomous vehicles, and inquired about using its space. On top of this, yesterday the WSJ reported that Apple is speeding up its efforts to build an electric car, eyeing 2019 for initial shipments. It\\'s become well known that Apple\\'s car initiative has been code named \"Titan\". Note that Apple has not commented on any of these developments. How will investors think about, model and value the market opportunity? We believe the opportunity for tech firms to disrupt the auto industry is large enough to fundamentally and permanently change how investors view transportationâ€¦ setting off a wholesale reassessment of end market sizing, growth, competitive dynamic, margin potential and valuation. Why is the story of Apple potentially getting involved in cars so important to the auto industry and to Apple? 1. The potential TAM is enormous. The addressable market for mobility is on the order of $10 trillion (10 trillion vehicle miles x $1/mile), more than 13% of global GDP. This figure ignores the value of the time of the driver, infrastructure, social and environmental costs. 2. The impact on electric vehicles is significant. If the worldâ€™s most                Morgan Stanley does and seeks to do business with companies covered in Morgan Stanley Research. As a result, valuable company were to make a car, we strongly believe it will be an all-           investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict electric, battery-powered vehicle. Having a company with Appleâ€™s resources            of interest that could affect the objectivity of Morgan Stanley Research. Investors should consider Morgan and technical expertise throw its weight behind EVs could accelerate                  Stanley Research as only a single factor in making their development and consumer adoption.                                                    investment decision.
